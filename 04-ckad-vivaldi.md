## Vivaldi  

On some occasions the Chrome browser may have problems and the proctor will ask you to switch to a new browser.

The new browser is usually [Vivaldi](https://vivaldi.com/)

If this happens you will have to install the new browser, and you may not have time to import the bookmarks to use during the exam.

If you are cautious like me I suggest you install Vivaldi in case you may have to make the switch and import the bookmarks ahead of time

<br />

### Vivaldi Installation

Download and install Vivaldi from [here](https://vivaldi.com/)

<br />

### Vivaldi Import Bookmarks

Once Vivaldi is installed import the CKAD Bookmarks:
* Accessing the Bookmark Manager 
* Go to Start Page
* Use a Keyboard Shortcut `Ctrl+B` / ⌃ `⌘ B` 
* Top Right...Import button
* Dropdown...Bookmarks HTML File...Choose File

Bookmarks:
* On the bookmark bar
* Look for a folder that say `Imported`...`CKAD/CKA`
* The imported bookmarks will be in this folder
