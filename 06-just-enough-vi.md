# Just Enough vi
* This is an introduction to `vi` to assist you in preparing for the CKAD exam

## What is vi
* vi is a screen editor for Linux, Unix and other Unix-like operating systems
* Pronounced (vee-aye), vi stands for visual instrument
* [vi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vi) and [vim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_(text_editor)) are interchangeable
* The examples below work for both vi and vim

## Important vi/vim concepts

* `vi` has two modes
    * `command mode` - issue commands such as deleting, copying, saving and search and replace
    * `-- INSERT -- mode` -  paste text or edit the file
      * You are in insert mode if you see `-- INSERT --` at the bottom of the file
      * If you are in `-- INSERT --` mode, use the `Esc` key to return to `command mode`

* You will be switching between these two modes while editing the file
  * In `command mode` perform common actions such as navigation, search and save
    * Once you are at the line you want to edit, you switch to `-- INSERT -- mode`
  * In `-- INSERT -- mode` make text changes to the file 
    * When done making changes you switch back to `command mode`  to save and exit

## vi/vim examples

<details class="faq box"><summary>Create a sample configuration file</summary>
<p>

```bash
clear
mkdir -p ~/ckad/
kubectl run pod-1 --image=nginx --dry-run=client -o yaml > ~/ckad/01-02.yml
```

</p>

<p>

Navigation - While in `command mode`
* Arrow keys - move the cursor down, up, left and right 
* `^` (caret) - move cursor to beginning of current line
* `$` - move cursor to end of the current line
